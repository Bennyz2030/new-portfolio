      <p><strong>My name is Nick Benzinger, and here is a little bit about me;</strong><br>I am currently a full stack student at Epicodus where I am focusing on JavaScript, C#, and React. I worked in the service industry for almost 10 years (yikes!), and recently decided to leave all that behind to persue a career in programming. <br>I was born and raised in <em>Oregon</em>, and i love everything about my beautiful state. I feel Oregon is very unique and provides many oppritunities to explore the outdoors in lots of different ways. I have fallen in love with the outdoors growing up here. Below is a list of some of my favorite things to do:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Snowboarding</li>
        <li>Skateboarding</li>
        <li>Kayaking</li>
        <li>Backpacking</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I also love to draw and paint. In the last few years I have found a hobby in modding old game consoles. I have built many different systems, but I love working on old gameboys the most.<br><strong><em>Follow the links below to learn about my job and education history, and also make sure to check out some of my GitHub repositories.</em></strong></p>
