      <h2>Hi there!</h2>
      <p><strong>My name is Nick Benzinger, and here is a little bit about me;</strong><br>I am currently a full stack student at Epicodus where I am focusing on JavaScript, C#, and React. I worked in the service industry for almost 10 years (yikes!), and recently decided to leave all that behind to persue a career in programming.
